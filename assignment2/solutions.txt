Problem 2

g.
SELECT sum(term) FROM (
    SELECT A.row_num, B.col_num, A.value*B.value as term
    FROM A,B
    WHERE A.col_num=B.row_num
)

Problem 3

h.
SELECT sum(count) AS similarity FROM (
    SELECT f1.docid AS doc1, f2.docid AS doc2, f1.count*f2.count AS count
    FROM frequency f1, frequency f2
    WHERE f1.term=f2.term
)
WHERE doc1='10080_txt_crude' AND doc2='17035_txt_earn';

i.
CREATE VIEW query AS

UNION
SELECT 'q' as docid, 'taxes' as term, 1 as count
UNION 
SELECT 'q' as docid, 'treasury' as term, 1 as count;

SELECT doc1, max(similarity) FROM (
